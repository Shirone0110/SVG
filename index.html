            <h3>What is scale?</h3>
            <p>Scale is a function that is used to convert a dataset in a specific domain into a different data set in a specific range. We can use scaleLinear, scaleSqrt, scalePow to scale data linear, square root, or exponential. Since the unit of the website is pixel, and unit of whatever out data is would probably not pixel, so we need something to convert betweem those units, and it's scale.</p>
            <h3>Why is it useful?</h3>
            <p>Scale can be used to transform data set with very big values to smaller values while keeping the scale of the original data set in order to express the data into visualizations.<br />
            Another use of scale is it has a built-in function <code>.clamp()</code> which can help ensure the input data is valid, so our program won't crash.</p>
